        <h1>Other Interests</h1>
        <p>Outside of classes, here's what I'm interested in.</p>
        <li>I enjoy working out, primarily lifting weights.</li>
        <li>Being active in other ways is also important to me, like going on walks and playing sports recreationally. My favorites to play are basketball and pickleball.</li>
        <li>I am in a band in my hometown of Garrettsville, Ohio. We mainly cover rock songs and play during the summers. I am the trombonist in the group.</li>
        <li>Other than that, I like to watch both professional and collegiate sports. Going to games in person is always a good time for me, too.</li>
        <li>I like to get out and explore different restaurants in Cleveland and the surrounding areas.</li>
        <li>I enjoy the outdoors, too. I have gotten in to fishing and hiking more recently.</li>
        <li>Watching TV and movies is usually a part of my life too, as well as is playing video games and reading books. I like <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> books and movies, and <i>The Sopranos</i> is my favorite show. </li>
        <li>I also like listening to music. Some of my favorite arists are Jack Johnson, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Chicago, Billy Joel, and Watsky.</li>
